There are two fundamental problems with the existing document markup languages: Either they are not easy to use, or they are not well suited to write complex documents, such as technical articles, user manuals, or books. An example of “not easy to use, but suited for complex documents” would be Docbook. An example of “easy to use, but not suited for complex documents” would be Markdown.

Of course, the above categorization is simplistic. But it should serve as a good starting point to get the gist of this article which aims to delineate the kind of problems that occur in practice. You’ll see many representative examples of markup code that illustrates what’s wrong, complemented by links to more information.

You’ll also discover a new markup language. Lots of examples will demonstrate how a new syntax can lead to a language that is “easy to use and suited for complex document.

## Documenting Python
  The Python language has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is reStructuredText, developed by the docutils project, amended by custom directives and using a toolset named Sphinx to post-process the HTML.


### Introduction

Python’s documentation has long been considered to be good for a free programming language. There are a number of reasons for this, the most important being the early commitment of Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, to providing documentation on the language and its libraries, and the continuing involvement of the user community in providing assistance for creating and maintaining documentation.

In the Python documentation, the use of sentence case in section titles is preferable, but consistency within a unit is more important than following this rule. If you add a section to a chapter where most sections are in title case, you can either convert all titles to sentence case or use the dominant style in the new section title.

Sentences that start with a word for which specific rules require starting it with a lower case letter should be avoided.


### MARKUP LANGUAGE

This is debatable, but markup language is not considered to be a programming language simply because the term is not well-defined. A markup language is used to control the presentation of the data, like representing structured data. For example, HTML is used to specify that some part of a document is a title, another part is a list, another part is heading etc. So, based off of that, a markup language is used to describe the data and the formatting in a textual format. There is a general rule, that a markup language will not describe a process or an algorithm (like programming language does) but is just pure data.
